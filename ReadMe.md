## Who/Why?
Hi, my name is Jelle Adyns and I'm a Game Development student at [Howest - Digital Arts & Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/).
The JelA Engine is a personal project that serves the purpose of gaining a deeper understanding of C++. It's supposed to constantly evolve in order to learn many diverse fields of Engine Programming and to stay up-to-date with modern C++.
